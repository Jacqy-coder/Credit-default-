# 🏦 Credit Risk Assessment Project

## 📌 Problem Definition

This project aims to develop a **machine learning model** that accurately assesses **credit risk** for loan applicants. Effective credit risk assessment is essential for financial institutions to **minimize losses** from loan defaults and make **data-driven lending decisions**.

By predicting the probability of loan default, lenders can:
- Approve or reject applications with greater confidence
- Set more appropriate interest rates
- Manage overall portfolio risk more effectively

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes a variety of applicant and loan features such as:
- Demographics (e.g., age, employment type)
- Financial details (e.g., income, loan amount, interest rate)
- Credit history and behavior

**Target variable**:  
`loan_status`  
- `1` = Defaulted  
- `0` = Not Defaulted  

This is a **binary classification** problem.

## ⚠️ Challenges Addressed

1. **Handling Missing Data**  
   - Some features have missing or null values that must be treated appropriately.

2. **Categorical Feature Encoding**  
   - Converting non-numeric attributes into a suitable format for model input.

3. **Class Imbalance**  
   - The distribution of defaulted vs. non-defaulted loans is skewed, requiring careful consideration during model training (e.g., through sampling techniques or appropriate evaluation metrics).

4. **Feature Selection**  
   - Identifying and retaining the most predictive features for model accuracy and interpretability.

5. **Evaluation Metrics for Imbalanced Data**  
   - Using metrics like **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-Score**, and **AUC-ROC** to better understand model performance.

6. **Interpretability**  
   - Ensuring the model results can be interpreted to highlight factors contributing to high-risk predictions, supporting business decisions.
